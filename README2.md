# Purpose

In this project, we used starter code to make a readme generator. We had to install node modules and use the inquirer package to do this project. The purpose of this project was to get familiar with ideas learned on node.js.

# Criteria
1. The user is prompted for information about the application.
2. A high quality README.md is generated with the title of the project, and sections that include description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.
3. The title appears at the top of the README when entered.
4. All of the sections have information and that information is placed appropriately.
5. A badge for the license chosen is at the top of the ReadME.
6. The github username and email are attached to the readme with instructions on how to reach the author.
7. The links on the table of contents take the user to the corresponding section of the readMe.


# Notes
This project started off well. I feel like I am getting better step by step but I still need to practice on all of this. The only real problem I had was getting my readme preview to update. I would make a change and it wouldn't populate in the preview but it would in the actual file. It was weird but after a quick google search I realized that VScode does this sometimes and the easiest way to fix it is to just close out of the application completely. For this project I was suppose to submit a readME file created by the application, that is why there are two READMEs in this repo. README.md is the file generated by the application. README.md 2 is the actual readme for the project.
