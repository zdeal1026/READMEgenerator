# Purpose

In this project, we used starter code to make a readme generator. We had to install node modules and use the inquirer package to do this project

# Criteria
1. The user is prompted for information about the application.
2. A high quality README.md is generated with the title of the project, and sections that include description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.
3. The title appears at the top of the README when entered.
4. All of the sections have information and that information is placed appropriately.
5. A badge for the license chosen is at the top of the ReadME.
6. The github username and email are attached to the readme.
7. 


# Notes
This was fairly challenging for a first time coder. I am looking forward to coming back and reworking this webpage in the future. It will be exciting to see what new skills I can add next time!
