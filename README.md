## Description

In this project we built a readme generator. We were given a starter code and asked to finish it. We had to install node modules and include the packages we wanted to run the application. Then we created functions to run the page that generated the README file and placed the appropriate things in the appropriate places. 

## Installation

open the project, run "npm i" to install node modules, and use the .gitignore file to hold the nodules that you don't want to upload to github

## Usage

open the index.js in the terminal and from the command line run the command "node index.js", you will then be prompted from the inquirer package that we installed to answer questions for your README, when you finish answering the questions your file will be generated
